  <h1>"My teenage daughter is using gang slurs like "lit" and "homie". I'm scared for her. What should I do?"</h1>
  <p>I hear her speak in words I know,  
From years ago, they start to show.  
"Lit" and "homie," terms I’ve heard,  
But in my mind, they stir a word.  

I think of gangs, the past I knew,  
Of meanings dark, and things that grew.  
Yet slang has changed, it’s not the same,  
The world moves on, and so does the name.  

"Homie" once was tied to the street,  
But now it’s just a friend to meet.  
"Lit" was high, but now it’s bright,  
A party term, a spark of light.  

I see her speak with those around,  
It’s not a threat, just youthful sound.  
I worry still, but here’s the key—  
It’s not about what used to be.  

The words are hers to twist and play,  
To shape her world in her own way.  
I'll ask her why, just where they’re from,  
And listen close, to where she's come.  

A moment shared, a gentle talk,  
I’ll guide her, not with fear or mock.  
For language shifts, as time will show,  
And words today might never go.
